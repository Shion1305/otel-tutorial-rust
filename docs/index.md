# OpenTelemetry + Rust + K6 Tutorial

Welcome to a comprehensive, production-ready tutorial demonstrating distributed observability with OpenTelemetry, Loki, Grafana, and Jaeger in Rust.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial guides you through building a complete observability stack for a Rust application:

- **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation**: Learn how to instrument Rust applications with distributed tracing
- **Structured Logging**: Implement structured JSON logging with Loki integration
- **Metrics Collection**: Capture application metrics with Prometheus
- **Visualization**: Create unified dashboards in Grafana
- **Load Testing**: Use K6 to simulate realistic user behavior and stress test your application
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy everything on Kubernetes with proper observability

## Quick Navigation
