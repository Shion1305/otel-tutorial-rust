  🐳 Infrastructure/
     ├── docker-compose.yml         - Full observability stack
     ├── Cargo.toml                 - Rust dependencies
     └── .env.example               - Environment configuration

GETTING STARTED (3 STEPS):

  1. Start the full stack:
     $ docker-compose up -d

  2. Build and run the application:
     $ cargo build --release
     $ RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/otel-tutorial

  3. Open the dashboards:
     - Grafana:  http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
     - Jaeger:   http://localhost:16686
     - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
     - Loki:     http://localhost:3100 (via Grafana)

TECHNOLOGY STACK:

  Backend:
    • Rust 1.70+ (edition 2024)
    • Actix-web (HTTP framework)
    • OpenTelemetry (tracing instrumentation)
    • Tracing (structured logging)
    
  Infrastructure:
    • Jaeger (distributed tracing backend)
    • Loki (log aggregation)
    • Prometheus (metrics collection)
    • Grafana (visualization)
    • Promtail (log collector)
    • Docker & Docker Compose (orchestration)

KEY CONCEPTS YOU'LL LEARN:

  Traces:  Complete journey of a request through the system
  Spans:   Individual operations within a trace
  Logs:    Structured events from the application
  Metrics: Quantitative measurements over time

LEARNING PATH:

  1. Read [Onboarding Guide](../guides/ONBOARDING.md)       (10 min) - Understand your journey
  2. Follow [Quick Start](../getting-started/QUICKSTART.md)  (5 min) - Get everything running
  3. Study [Tech Stack](../guides/TECH-STACK.md)             (30 min) - Learn how it all works
  4. Explore the source code                              (30 min) - See the implementation
  5. Read [Architecture Guide](../guides/ARCHITECTURE.md)    (30 min) - Deep dives and troubleshooting

WHAT THE APPLICATION DOES:

  Endpoints:
    GET  /api/health              - Simple health check
    GET  /api/users               - List all users
    POST /api/users               - Create a new user
    GET  /api/users/{id}          - Get user by ID
    POST /api/compute             - Compute fibonacci (CPU-intensive)

  Instrumentation:
    • Every endpoint is traced with detailed timing
    • Request IDs track requests through the system
    • Structured logs record all operations
    • Errors are automatically captured with context

FEATURES INCLUDED:

  ✅ Automatic span creation with #[tracing::instrument]
  ✅ Request ID middleware for correlation
  ✅ Structured JSON logging
  ✅ Jaeger trace visualization
  ✅ Loki log aggregation and search
  ✅ Prometheus metrics collection
  ✅ Grafana unified dashboard
  ✅ Production-ready Docker setup
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation
  ✅ Learning exercises and examples

DEPENDENCIES OVERVIEW:

  Tracing:
    • tracing = "0.1"
    • tracing-subscriber = "0.3" (with json, fmt features)
  
  OpenTelemetry:
    • opentelemetry = "0.20"
    • opentelemetry-jaeger = "0.19"
    • tracing-opentelemetry = "0.21"
  
  Web:
    • actix-web = "4.4"
    • actix-rt = "2.9"
  
  Data:
    • serde = "1.0"
    • uuid = "1.6"
    • chrono = "0.4"

PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:

  For moving to production:
    • Use persistent storage for Jaeger and Prometheus
    • Add authentication to Grafana
    • Enable TLS/HTTPS for data in transit
    • Set up proper log retention policies
    • Configure alerting rules
    • Use a distributed database instead of local storage
    • Scale components based on traffic volume
    • Add service discovery for multiple instances

CUSTOMIZATION:

  To add to your own project:
    1. Copy src/observability.rs
    2. Add observability dependencies to Cargo.toml
    3. Call setup_telemetry() in main()
    4. Add #[tracing::instrument] to functions
    5. Adjust docker-compose.yml for your services
    6. Point your app's traces to Jaeger

TESTING THE SETUP:

  Generate observability data:
    # Terminal 1: Start the app
    ./target/release/otel-tutorial
    
    # Terminal 2: Make requests
    curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
    curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'
    
    # View in Grafana (logs), Jaeger (traces), Prometheus (metrics)

TROUBLESHOOTING:

  Containers won't start?
    $ docker-compose logs
    
  Can't see logs in Loki?
    Wait 15 seconds for Promtail to collect, then refresh Grafana
    
  Jaeger shows no traces?
    Check JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=localhost in your environment
    
  Grafana datasources failing?
    Verify the internal Docker network: docker network inspect observability

NEXT STEPS:

  1. ✅ Complete [Quick Start](../getting-started/QUICKSTART.md) and get everything running
  2. ✅ Understand [Tech Stack](../guides/TECH-STACK.md) concepts
  3. ✅ Study the source code examples
  4. ✅ Create your own instrumented Rust service
  5. ✅ Add custom metrics and dashboards
  6. ✅ Deploy to production with proper storage
